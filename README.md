👉**Explainer Dashboard**

ExplainerDashboard is a library for quickly building interactive dashboards for analyzing and explaining the predictions and workings of (scikit-learn compatible) machine learning models, including xgboost, catboost and lightgbm. This makes your model transparant and explainable with just two lines of code. It is a python package which generates interactive dashboards which allow users to understand as well as explain how the model works and how it is deciding the outcome. Without such a tool, a machine learning model is a “Black Box model” . Hence, it becomes difficult to explain the reason behind the decision made by the model and which factors are impacting its decision making.
