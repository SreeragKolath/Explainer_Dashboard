## Explainer Dashboard

ðŸ‘‰**what is Explainer Dashboard**

explainerdashboard is a library for quickly building interactive dashboards for analyzing and explaining the predictions and workings of (scikit-learn compatible) machine learning models, including xgboost, catboost and lightgbm. This makes your model transparant and explainable with just two lines of code. 

It allows you to investigate SHAP values, permutation importances, interaction effects, partial dependence plots, all kinds of performance plots, and even individual decision trees inside a random forest. With explainerdashboard any data scientist can create an interactive explainable AI web app in minutes, without having to know anything about web development or deployment.
